# Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with LSTM, GRU, TCN, MLP

## The process of Multivariate Time Series Forecasting:

- Data preparation
- Data visualization
- Training and testing model

## Dataset 1: CNU
- We have 6 sub-datasets but we just try to experiment with one sub-dataset: "Engineering-building-7"
- There are including 4 features: "date","temperatures","humidity","pressure","energy"
- Some NULL values in the dataset, we need to handle it

```
- We need to fill the NULL values with the mean of the column
```python
# fill the missing values using linear interpolation
df.interpolate(method='linear', inplace=True)
```
